# Forms and challenges of communication with teleworking in research, facing quaranteens and global warming

Some work domains clearly require physical presence, at least for now, until automation phase out physical presence of people. I will not discuss these here.

Some other domains, certain parts of research including, do not necessarily suffer from teleworking. Or do they? The opinions are somewhat divided, but there is general agreement that they do, since most people still work in the offices and go for in-person meetings. 
The exact in non-obvious and hard-to-pinpoint ways.

The purpose of this note is to identify different forms of communication, and determine what makes some of these forms favor strongly physical co-presence.


* highly interactive communication: can be addressed in part with chats mattermost/slack, but lacks video presence. video chats partly resolve this issue.
* spotaneous communication triggered by co-presence
* informal tangential communication

## Recreating office space

A simple path to address these challenges would be to make a close analog of office space.

Useful experience can be derived from a major remote-only company, gitlab.

## Pro-s of teleworking

greener: electricity, transport

## Solutions with the experience learned

what is missing in teleworking is *random unsoliticed interactions*

proposed solution:

* contiue teleworking most of the time, using the online tools
* facilitate and ensure mixed online/in-person meetings
* maximize random unsoliticed interactions (?) by aligning presense with Presence Announcement Formulaire
