# Review challenges of teleworking in research, in conditions of quaranteen and global warming

Some work domains clearly require physical presence, at least for now, until automation phase out physical presence of people.

Some other domains, certain parts of research including, do not necessarily suffer from teleworking. Or do they? The opinions are divided, but there is a common opinion that they do, in non-obvious and hard-to-pinpoint ways.
The purpose of this note is to identify different forms of communication, and determine what makes some of these forms favor strongly physical co-presence.



Useful experience can be derived from a major remote-only company, gitlab.
